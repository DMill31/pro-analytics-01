# Pro Analytics 01: Setup and Workflow Guide

This repository provides a clear, concise guide to help set up a machine for Python projects, 
initialize a new Python project, and follow a repeatable project workflow 
when developing professional Python projects. 

The instructions are divided into three main sections.

## First: Setup Machine and Sign up for GitHub
Go to [01-machine-setup](01-machine-setup/MACHINE-SETUP.md) to prepare for Python projects.
Start here to set up a machine for the first time (or to upgrade or verify professional tools).

This section contains **one-time tasks** including:
1. View file extensions and hidden files and folders.
2. Install (or verify) a package manager for your operating system.
3. Install Python, Git, and Visual Studio (VS) Code for your operating system.
4. Configure Git
5. Install common VS Code extensions.
6. Create a Projects folder to hold your projects. 
7. Create a GitHub account.

## 02-Project-Initialization
Go to [02-Project-Initialization](02-Project-Initialization/) when **starting a new project**.

This section walks you through the steps to either:
1. Copy an existing project OR start a new project from scratch.
2. Clone your new GitHub repo to your machine. 
3. Add common files such as .gitignore and requirements.txt.
4. Git add-commit-push the changes to GitHub.
5. Create a local project virtual environment for Python.

## 03-Repeatable-Workflow
Go to [03-Repeatable-Workflow](03-Repeatable-Workflow/) for ongoing project development.

This section provides the **repeatable steps** for working on Python projects. 
These steps are typically followed whenever we make changes to a project. The workflow includes:
1. Pull any recent changes from GitHub.
2. Activate the virtual environment.
3. Install dependencies.
4. Run scripts and/or Jupyter notebooks.
5. Make updates, verify the code still runs, and git add-commit-push to GitHub.

## Important

- Follow the instructions carefully.
- Follow the instructions in the recommended order.
- Verify each step before proceeding.
