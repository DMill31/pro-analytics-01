This page provides instructions to install common Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions for Python development.

## Open VS Code

Open your VS Code editor. We'll use the built-in Extensions Marketplace to install extensions.

## Access the Extensions Marketplace

Use the VS Code menu to navigate to View > Extensions (or press Ctrl+Shift+X on Windows or Cmd+Shift+X on Mac). This will open the Extensions panel.

## Install the Following Extensions

Search for and install the following extensions in the Extensions panel:

1. Python  
   - Publisher: Microsoft  
   - Provides IntelliSense, debugging, and support for Jupyter notebooks.

2. Jupyter  
   - Publisher: Microsoft  
   - Enables support for running and debugging Jupyter notebooks.

3. Pylance  
   - Publisher: Microsoft  
   - Provides advanced language support for Python.

4. Black Formatter
   - Publisher: Microsoft  
   - Formats Python code to comply with PEP 8 standards automatically.

## Verify Installation

After installing, restart VS Code and verify that the extensions appear in the Extensions panel. 

## Notes

- Extensions are updated regularly, so ensure they are kept up to date.
- Additional extensions may be helpful depending on the project. 
- When VS Code recommends an extension, it is usually a good idea to try it.
